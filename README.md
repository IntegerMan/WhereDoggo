# Where Doggo

This project is an AI simulation of a variant of the popular Werewolf and One Night Ultimate Werewolf games by [Bezier Games](https://beziergames.com/).

The purpose of this project is to try to build AI bots that can make reasoned deductions in a social deduction type of game and decieve each other and even human players.

This does not emulate the full spectrum of social interactions possible in the commercial games and so I am playfully calling these variants "Where Doggo" instead. 
The game features rabbits and doggos as opposed to villagers and wherewolves. The point of the game is for the doggos to evade detection by the rabbits and ultimately vote
out a rabbit instead of a doggo.
